# Technical Test
The test is divided in two parts, each part of the test should use it’s own git repository . You
should just send us links to both repos in the reply.

1. Code Quality
We want to evaluate good coding practices in general, nothing ruby/javascript specific.
Check the provided code. It’s a ruby/node.js 4 command line script. Your objective is to improve
the code quality.
Rewrite the code following code to make it better (choose only one file, they are the same
program) : [link](https://gist.github.com/plataforma-co/e2caad8722e5767d996b9721281bffac) .
You are given complete freedom on how to accomplish this, the only limit being you should not
change the expected functionality (it should still log in users using in-memory user/password
combinations). You may even change the signatures, rename methods, create more classes,
etc.
You’ll need to provide us with a github (bitbucket or gitlab are also fine) repository. Each commit
should describe what you are improving and why.
